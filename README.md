Demo application for my belgian techdays talk. It has a rewrite of the official techdays 2013 be app targetting both Windows Phone, Windows 8 and Android. For this, I used portable class libraries, Xamarin and MvvmCross. You can find the actual talk at http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDays/Belgium-2013/84.
