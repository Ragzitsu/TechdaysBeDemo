Any time a DirectAccess client is on and has connectivity to the public Internet it is automatically and securely connected to the internal corporate network. For a DirectAccess client, the experience for accessing on-premises data and applications is exactly the same regardless of physical location. Since the DirectAccess connection is bi-directional it provides IT professionals with the ability to manage, update, and monitor remote systems more efficiently than with legacy VPN. As a feature of Windows Server 2008 R2, DirectAccess was challenging to deploy and required significant infrastructure changes to implement. Some of the shortcomings of DirectAccess were addressed by Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG) 2010, but UAG came with additional complexity and expense. DirectAccess in Windows Server 2012 has been improved tremendously. DirectAccess can be configured in a simplified deployment scenario with little effort and requires no changes be made to existing network infrastructure. DirectAccess in Windows Server 2012 also provides support for multi-site deployments with intelligent entry point selection, as well as substantial improvements with security, scalability, and performance. Deploying Windows Server 2012 DirectAccess comes with many benefits, including improved productivity and reduced help desk costs, as well as improved endpoint security.
